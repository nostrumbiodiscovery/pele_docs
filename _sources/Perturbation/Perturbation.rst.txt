Perturbation Block in Pele++ control file
=========================================

.. warning::

  You can skip the ligand perturbation phase in your PELE simulation by not including the ``"Perturbation"`` block in your simulation. However, if you do so, remember not to include any configuration related to it (such as a BindingEnergy metric), and also remember that the default values for some options (such as the links to be considered in the side chain prediction phase) may differ, causing that you simulation may not start or even work differently as you expect.

How perturbation of the ligand works
------------------------------------

The perturbation block controls the perturbation of the ligand. The ligand, formed by a rigid core (at least one atom) and a set of side chains, is perturbed by translating and rotating it, relieving any existing clash that may appear ([borrelli:2010]_). PELE creates a list of perturbation poses (typically configured to be between 1 and 20; see :ref:`sec-perturbation-parameters-numberOfTrials`), and then chooses the one with the lowest system energy. Each perturbation pose is generated through a random procedure, where a number of translations and rotations are tried (see :ref:`sec-perturbation-parameters-numberOfStericTrials`), until a combination is found that doesn't show any steric clashes after the clash relieving process. To allow the macromolecule to adapt to the new ligand position, clashes of up to 30% of the van der Waals interatomic distance between atoms are allowed (see :ref:`sec-perturbation-parameters-overlapFactor`), since the relaxation phase will probably relieve them. When searching the binding site, large translations are tried (around :math:`6 \AA{}`), while once in the binding site, small adjusments of less than :math:`1 \AA{}` are used (see :ref:`sec-perturbation-parameters-translationRange`). In addition, to allow the sampling of rare events, it is possible to force the translational vector to follow a randomly selected direction (what would be a steering vector) a given number of simulation steps, giving room to some small deviations (within :math:`10^{\circ}` to :math:`30^{\circ}`); in case of not finding a non-clashing translation, or after the round is finished, the steering vector is changed by a new one (see :ref:`sec-perturbation-steering`). Also, for those simulations that require exploring a restricted volume of the search space (as it is done in binding pose refinement), all ligand perturbations that place the ligand center of mass outside a predefined box are rejected (see :ref:`sec-boxes`).

The clash relieving process consists of trying different conformations on the flexible side chains of the ligand and macromolecule. If a clash exists between the cores of the ligand and receptor, then the pose is discarded. Otherwise, while there exists any clash around the ligand, a clashing residue (or the ligand) is randomly chosen, and a new conformation for its side chains is tried.

The time of a perturbation can vary depending on the number of rotable bonds and the resolution. To avoid large computational times, and even not having the amount of memory needed to perform a big number of combinations, PELE automatically does a random combination of the rotable bonds.

When you create a LIG.rot.assign file (see :ref:`sec-molecularParameters`), PELE has the following criteria to select the rotatable bonds **in each group**:

-  If there are less or equal than **3** rotatable bonds, all of them will be selected to rotate regardless of the resolution.
  -  If there are more than 3 rotatable bonds, and if it exists any resolution lower than :math:`30^{\circ}`, the maximum number or rotatable bonds to rotate in each steric try will be **3**.
-  If all resolutions are :math:`30^{\circ}` or higher, the maximum number or rotatable bonds to rotate in each steric try will be **5**.

The probability of selection will vary, being the inner ones more likely to be selected than the outer ones. 
Right now, the values of the weights are asigned to each rotamer bond, starting from 10 in the most inner bond, and descending from 1 to 1 until the last one. If it has more than 10 rotatable bonds, the last ones will be keep with weight 1.

For example, given this case of an oleic acid:

::

  rot assign res OLC &
    sidelib FREE30 _C9_ _C8_	
    sidelib FREE30 _C8_ _C7_ &
    sidelib FREE30 _C7_ _C6_ &
    sidelib FREE30 _C6_ _C5_ &
    sidelib FREE30 _C5_ _C4_ &
    sidelib FREE30 _C4_ _C3_ &
    sidelib FREE30 _C3_ _C2_ &
    sidelib FREE30 _C2_ _C1_ &
      newgrp &
    sidelib FREE30 _C10 _C11 &
    sidelib FREE30 _C11 _C12 &
    sidelib FREE30 _C12 _C13 &
    sidelib FREE10 _C13 _C14 &
    sidelib FREE30 _C14 _C15 &
    sidelib FREE30 _C15 _C16 &
    sidelib FREE30 _C16 _C17 &

In this case, the first group will have 5 random rotatable bonds, and in the second one, 3.
In the first group, the weight distribution for _C9_ _C8_ would be 10, for _C8_ _C7_ 9, until reaching _C2_ _C1_ with 3.

.. _sec-perturbation-steering:

Steering
--------

Through the :ref:`sec-perturbation-perturbationSelection-translationDirection` option you can control whether to activate steering or not. Even when the steering is active, you can temporarily deactivate it by setting the update frequency to zero (:ref:`sec-perturbation-parameters-steeringUpdateFrequency`).

There are two kinds of steering, and they can be configured through :ref:`sec-perturbation-parameters-steeringMode`.

A steering cycle spreads through the perturbation phases of several PELE steps, consisting of ``steeringUpdateFrequency`` steps (see :ref:`sec-perturbation-parameters-steeringUpdateFrequency`). A steering vector is selected in each cycle, and all translations during that cycle will be based on that steering vector, with a Gaussian dispersion. After a steering cycle ends, a new steering vector is selected.

The ``random`` steering mode, selects a random steering vector before starting a new steering cycle. The ``best`` steering mode, selects as steering vector the translation vector of the perturbation selected in the first iteration of the steering cycle (therefore, the steering vector will be applied only during the next iterations in this case).

Notice that when using the ``proximityDistance`` option (:ref:`sec-peleParameters-proximityDistance`), if the ligand is far, the perturbation during that step will not use a steering vector, and a new steering cycle will start in the next PELE step.

If you change the ``steeringUpdateFrequency`` or the ``steeringMode`` to a different value during the simulation (see :ref:`sec-parametersThatCanChange`), a new steering cycle starts. Also, if during a steering cycle, while generating a particular perturbation (for a maximum of ``numberOfStericTrials``), the ligand always goes out of the configured box, then the steering vector is considered to get nowhere, and a new steering cycle is considered to have started (which implies selecting new steering vectors).

   distribution centered on "translatinRange", [0.75 \*
   "translationRange", 1.25 \* "translationRange"].

rotationAngles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are two options to generate the rotation angles using the
rotationScalingFactor.

Default value: "nonCoupled"

-  coupled: The same rotationScalingFactor is used for every angle.

    - :math:`\phi = \text{rotationScalingFactor} * \text{rand}(-2\pi, 2\pi)`

    - :math:`\psi = \text{rotationScalingFactor} * \text{rand}(-2\pi, 2\pi)`

number in the interval between brackets.

-  nonCoupled: Randomly, rotationScalingFactor is assigned to either 1,
   2 or 3 angles at random. For the rest, a rotationScalingFactor of
   0.02 is assigned. The angle is computed as follows: for a target
   angle :math:`\text{TA} = \text{FAR} * \text{rotationScalingFactor}`, :math:`\text{angle} = \text{sign}(\text{rand}) * \text{rand}((1-\text{RRF})*\text{TA}, (1+\text{RRF}) * \text{TA})`, where FAR (full angle range) is :math:`2\pi` for
   :math:`\phi` and :math:`\psi`, and :math:`\pi` for :math:`\theta`, and RRF is the rotationRangeFactor.

^^^^^^^^^^^^

Parameter: string steeringMode

Use: It selects how the steering vector is calculated.

resolution stated in the rotamer library file for that link; therefore
this parameter does not affect them. The angles a rotamer can take are
divided in bins of length 'gridResolution' degrees.

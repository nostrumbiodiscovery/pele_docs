External Requirements: OpenMPI

Send an e-mail to daniel.soler@nostrumbiodiscovery.com if you are interested on receiving the commercial software. 
After revision of your application, we will send you a form to fill in with your machine specifications.
Then, you will recieve the PELE (pele.zip) binary containing the licenses to run and a test case to check the installation.

*******************************
Version 1.6.1
*******************************
- New algorithm is performed when doing a Ligand Perturbation, if the Ligand has a large number of rotable bonds. The rotable bonds now will be **randomly selected** following a freedom criteria. This is done in **each group**.
    - If there are 3 or less rotable bonds, all are studied and no random selection is done.
    - If there are more than 3 rotable bonds:
        - If the lowest resolution is < 30, **3** rotable bonds will be randomly selected.
        - It not, **5** rotable bonds will be randomly selected.
- Behaviour improvements for **WaterMC** in Ligand Perturbation algorithm.
- Default **Steering Value** changed from 2 to 1.
- Default **Steric Trial** value changed from 1000 to 50.
- Fixed and refactored Tests.
- Fixed some errors with Simbolic Link creation in MNIV and NORD3.
- Some errors now are printed properly through cerr and not cout.
- Fixed memory leaks.
- Changed error outputs from cout to cerr. Errors now should be displayed in terminal.

***********
Version 1.6
***********
- **Cylindrical boxes** can be defined for the ligand perturbation with the new *CylindricalBox* option.
- **Multiple spherical** boxes can also be defined for the ligand perturbation with the new *MultiSphericalBox* option.
- New **WaterPerturbation** (wMC) step is included in the PELE algorithm to explore water sites along the simulation with a Metropolis Monte Carlo approach.
- **WaterSites** are regions where the user can specify explicit water molecules that need to be perturbed inside a certain spherical box in the wMC step.
- **LigandPerturbation** algorithms are changed to allow the ligand to be placed over explicit water molecules that are perturbed in the wMC step.
- New **verbose mode** allow the user to chose between an extended or a condensed logfile.
- Some repeated and useless lines were removed from **logfile ouputs**.
- **Symbolic links** to Data and Documents folders are automatically created when PELE initiates.
- In case the **output folder** does not exist, it will be created when PELE initiates.
- Several issues with **PELE tests** were solved in this release.
- Now when a atom is not found, instead printing **"total mass is too small: 0"** tells which atom and where is located.
- When running PELE in serial mode, **Complex keyword failure** has a better error description.
- Many **other minor changes** are introduced to improve the performance of PELE and to fix small issues.

********
rev12510
********

********
rev12489
********

********
rev12360
********

- Change default rotamer resolution to 10 degrees, both in perturbation and in side chain prediction phases (rev. 12289).
- Pass per-complex configuration properties in the control file (fixTrees, fixChainNames, allowMissingTerminals) to global properties (top level properties under "Initialization"), so that they apply to all PDB reading in the simulation, and not in a per-complex basis (rev. 12308).

- Default values for control file parameters change (rev. 12043).
- Command line parameter --license-directory eases indication of the directory with the license (rev. 12032).
- Control files now allow line comments (rev. 12030).

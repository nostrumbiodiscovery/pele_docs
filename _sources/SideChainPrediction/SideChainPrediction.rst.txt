.. _sec-sideChainPrediction:

SideChainPrediction Block in Pele++ control file
================================================

This block configures the Side Chain Prediction phase in a ``peleSimulation`` command, or the Side Chain Prediction execution of a ``sideChainSimulation`` command. In a ``peleSimulation``, this phase will be active depending on the ``sideChainPredictionFrequency`` PELE parameter (:ref:`sec-peleParameters-sideChainPredictionFrequency`).

The side chain prediction will be applied to the set of links formed by:

- if ``sideChainPredictionRegionRadius`` (:ref:`sec-peleParameters-sideChainPredictionRegionRadius`) is not zero, then the links to perturb (if the perturbation phase is active) and all those other links that are at most ``sideChainPredictionRegionRadius`` :math:`\AA{}` away from the links to perturb.
- the *top side links*, which are those links that worsen their energy the most between the beginning of a PELE step and the end of the perturbation and ANM phase. The number of these links is selected by the PELE parameter ``numberOfTopSideSelectedLinks`` (:ref:`sec-peleParameters-numberOfTopSideSelectedLinks`). Also the links that are at most ``topSideRadius`` :math:`\AA{}` away from the *top side links* (:ref:`sec-peleParameters-topSideRadius`) will be included.
- the links selected with ``selectionToInclude`` (:ref:`sec-sideChainPrediction-selectionToInclude`).
- removing, from all the links previously selected, those links in ``selectionToOmit`` (:ref:`sec-sideChainPrediction-selectionToOmit`).

Notice that links without side chains and cross linked cysteines are not considered in the side chain prediction.


Algorithm selection
-------------------

algorithm
^^^^^^^^^

Use: It sets the side chain prediction algorithm that will be used.

Possible options:

-  "zhexin": Iterative algorithm that predicts the side chain
   conformation for each link until it reaches convergence
-  "boltzmannSampling": Algorithm that samples the rotamers according to
   the Boltzmann distribution at a given temperature T

Default value: ``"zhexin"``.

Brief description of the algorithms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Zhexin algorithm: It is an iterative algorithm that tries to find the
   most likely rotamer. To do so, it clusters the rotamers and estimates
   the partition function. It chooses the rotamer that has the greatest
   contribution. It is performed several times, until convergence is
   reached.
-  Boltzmann Sampling: It chooses a random rotamer according to the
   Boltzmann distribution. For all the non-clashing rotamers, their
   energies are evaluated and assigned their Boltzmann weight
   :math:`\frac{e^{-\beta E}}{\sum e^{-\beta E}}`. One is chosen according to this weight.

Links selection
---------------

.. _sec-sideChainPrediction-selectionToInclude:

selectionToInclude
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Parameter: Selector\* selector

Use: String used to select the links to which the side chain prediction
is going to be performed.

Note: It uses the standard jSon format.

This example selects from link "2" to "4" in the chain "A":

.. code-block:: json

    "selectionToInclude": { "links": {"ranges": ["A:2 A:4"] } }

For a more detailed description, see :ref:`sec-selectionExamples`.

.. _sec-sideChainPrediction-selectionToOmit:

selectionToOmit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Parameter: Selector\* omit

Use: String used to select the links to which the side chain prediction
is never going to be performed.

Note: It uses the standard jSon format. Omit prevails over include, i.e.
if a link is chosen in both lists, it is omitted.

See :ref:`sec-selectionExamples`.

.. _sec-sideChainPrediction-parameters:

Parameters
----------

resolution
^^^^^^^^^^

Parameter: double gridres

Use: Resolution of the rotamer library to be used for the 'non-polar'
part of non-ligand links (the polar part always uses the resolution
given in the link-type rotamer library file for the polar atom). Ligand
links always use the resolution stated in the rotamer library file for
that link; therefore this parameter does not affect them. The angles a
rotamer can take are divided in bins of length 'gridres' degrees.

Note for developers: Used all along the side chain prediction.

Units: Degrees

Range: It can take any value, generally 10, 20, 30, 40 (these are the
only values allowed for standard protein residues). If an unsupported
resolution is chosen, it is set to the base resolution for each type of
link, which is 10 in the standard protein residues.

Default value: 10

Plop info:

-  Plop control file name: 'gridres'
-  Plop parameter name: 'side\_params%gridres'
-  Plop default value: 10

.. _sec-sideChainPrediction-parameters-overlapfactor:

Overlap factor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We consider that two atoms are clashing when:

d12 < overlap\_factor \* (rvdw,1 + rvdw,2)

where d12 is the distance between them and rvdw,i is the Van der Waals
radius of the i-th atom.

The program starts looking for non-clashing rotamers with an overlap
factor = initial overlap factor. If it does not find any suitable
rotamer (i.e. the algorithm failed), it decreases its value
deltaOverlapFactor (=0.05). The process is repeated until overlap factor
= minimal overlap factor.

initialOverlapFactor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Parameter: double initialOverlapFactor

Use: Initial overlap factor.

Note for developers: Used in ZhexinSideChainAlgorithm::run

Units: Dimensionless

Default value: 0.75

Plop info:

-  Plop control file name: 'ofac\_init'
-  Plop parameter name: 'tree\_params%ofac\_init'
-  Plop default value: 0.75

minimalOverlapFactor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Parameter: double minimalOverlapFactor

Use: Minimal overlap factor. It is also used when we want a loose
selection of non-clashing rotamers.

Note for developers: Used everywhere we need to know if the algorithm
failed.

Units: Dimensionless

Default value: 0.7

Plop info:

-  Plop control file name: 'ofac\_min'
-  Plop parameter name: 'tree\_params%ofac\_min'
-  Plop default value: 0.7

randomize
^^^^^^^^^

Parameter: bool randomize

Use: It only makes sense when the 'zhexin' algorithm is used. It
randomizes the initial conformation of the selected links' side chains.
When it is false, ``numberOfIterations`` is not considered, since it becomes effectively 1.

Notes for developers: Used in
ZhexinSideChainAlgorithm::findMinimumInEnergyUsingRotamerLibrary and
ZhexinSideChainAlgorithm::findMinimumInEnergyUsingRotamerLibrary

Default value: false

Plop info:

-  Plop control file name: 'rand'
-  Plop parameter name: 'side\_params%randomize'
-  Plop default value: False

discardHighEnergySolutions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Parameter bool discardHighEnergySolutions

Use: If the side chain prediction does not have backbone clashes (though
it may have side chain clashes), but the solution structure has an
energy higher than the initial energy (at least, 10 kcal/mol), then that
solution is discarded if this parameter is true. When discarded, the
initial structure is retained.

Default value: false

Plop info:

-  Plop control file name: 'failsafe'
-  Plop parameter name: 'side_params%failsafe'
-  Plop default value: True

numberOfIterations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Parameter: unsigned int numberOfIterations

Use: Number of iterations that the 'zhexin' algorithm is going to
perform. This is only considered when ``randomize`` is true; otherwise, the effective number of iterations is 1.

Notes for developers: Used in
ZhexinSideChainAlgorithm::findMinimumInEnergyUsingRotamerLibrary

Units: Dimensionless

Range: [0, inf)

Default value: 1

Plop info:

-  Plop control file name: 'iter'
-  Plop parameter name: 'side\_params%niter'
-  Plop default value: 1

temperature
^^^^^^^^^^^

Parameter: double temperature

Use: Temperature to sample the rotamers in the 'boltzmannSampling'
algorithm

Notes for developers: Used in
SideChain::computeNonClashingRotamersProbabilities

Default value: 2000

Plop info:

-  Plop control file name: -
-  Plop parameter name: -
-  Plop default value: -

.. _sec-sideChainPrediction-sideChainPredictionMinimizer:

sideChainMinimizer
------------------

Minimizer block.

If this block is not present, then no side chain prediction minimization is run.

Check the minimization block documentation (:ref:`sec-minimization`) for more information.

If this section is present, then this minimization is run at the end of each side chain prediction iteration; the minimization affects only the atoms considered during the side chain prediction. In this case (the "sideChainMinimizer" block is present, so the internal minimization will be performed), the default minimization type is "TruncatedNewton", with the following default parameters (other parameters have the same default as shown in the minimization block documentation):

- "EnergyDifference": 1.0
- "MinimumRMS": 0.1
- "MaximumMinimizationIterations": 3
- "MaximumNewtonIterations": 65,
- "nonBondingListUpdatedEachMinStep": true
- "alphaUpdated": false
- "sgbUpdated": true
- "iterationsBetweenNBlistLongUpdate": 2


If the perturbation is active, also the perturbation constraints will be on (see :ref:`sec-peleParameters-perturbationCOMConstraintConstant`). The permanent constraints (:ref:`sec-permanentConstraints`) are also on.

A final relaxation minimization is executed at the end of the side chain prediction phase in a PELE simulation, but this is configured in the ``"Minimizer"`` section of such command (see :ref:`sec-minimization`).
